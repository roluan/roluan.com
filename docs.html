	<h3>Documentation</h3>
	<h4>Ternary system emulator</h4>
	<p>Represents software emulator for a ternary computer. It is a software copy as detailed 
	as possible for a real computer: mainboard, processor, RAM, hard disk, video card, etc. 
	All operations are done in ternary code, including hardware driver controllers, 
	interrupts and emulation of VGA monitor.<br /><br />
	As a proof of concept, two versions are planned: desktop and web. By using the desktop
	version, downloading, installing some additional components and compiling will be needed.
	Using the web means that all code will be executed on our servers and only the screen 
	will be shown in a web page. The detailed code documentation will be published soon.</p>
	
	<h4>Compiler</h4>
	<p>It is the hardest software part of this project. After releasing the first alpha of
	Emulator, a compiler from IL, produced by c# to Ternary Emulator Assembler will be published.</p>
